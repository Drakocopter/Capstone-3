# Capstone 3

I built and stylized a Microblog project for the front-end development class. Here are some screenshots from the project.

# [Login Page](./HTML/login.html)

Here is my login page. It's nothing super decorative right now, that is something I plan to work on later. The stacked Sticky Notes effect was an idea from my classmate Yareli. All that took was some stylized divs.

# [Register Page](./HTML/register.html)

This is the same as the login page, except it's to make a new user instead of logging in as an existing one.

# [Posts Page](./HTML/posts.html)

This is where the most work went into. From fetching the messages, getting the like button to work, and posting a message, it was a hassle. All while trying to deal with Bootstrap the server locking you out after too many requests. It was a chore, but it's done. 

For the most part.

One interesting line of code I wrote here was to replace the SVG of the empty heart icon to switch to the filled one on click (you'll find this in sticks.js). IT was quite fun to code and I enjoyed the end result.

# [Profile Page](./HTML/profile.html)

Last (and frankly least) was the profile page. It is the exact same as the other pages except its now doing a POST request to the API and switching the Bio of the user to whatever is typed into the textbox.

# Final Thoughts
Overall, I really liked the overall outcome of this project, but there is MUCH I want to improve. Unliking, deleting posts, as well as some extra decor and styling. But that will come much later, if at all. I'm happy to have my instructor, Kevin E. Long, be there on my coding journey. Thank you again.
